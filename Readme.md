This guide is part of his journey in exploring and sharing knowledge within the coding community.

The tasks outlined in this document are crafted to emulate the complexity and breadth of coding assessments typically encountered during technical interviews or coding competitions üß©. Each level introduces incrementally more complex problems, requiring a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles üìö.

## Pre-requisites

Before diving into the tasks and running the tests outlined in this guide, it's crucial to ensure that your development environment is properly set up. Here are the prerequisites necessary to run the test and simulation effectively:

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. This guide and the accompanying code are designed to work with Python 3.6 or newer. You can download Python from the official website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installation, you can verify the installation by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal or command prompt.

> **Important Note**: CodeSignal utilizes Python Version **3.10.6** for its assessments.

3. **Familiarity with Terminal or Command Prompt**: Basic knowledge of using the terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) will be beneficial. You will need to use it to run the test scripts provided in the `test_simulation.py` file.

4. **Install Required Python Packages**: Before starting with the tasks, it's essential to install the Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. These packages include necessary libraries that might be used throughout the tasks in this guide. To install these packages, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or
   ```
   /path/to/python3.10.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command tells pip, Python's package installer, to install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Ensure you are in the same directory as the `requirements.txt` file when running this command or provide the correct path to it. Installing these packages beforehand will ensure that you have all the necessary tools and libraries at your disposal, facilitating a smoother coding experience.
   > **Important Note**: When installing Python and the required packages, it is crucial to ensure that the version of Python installed matches the version used by CodeSignal, which is **3.10.6**. Additionally, verify that your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is configured to use the same Python interpreter. This consistency is essential for avoiding discrepancies in behavior or functionality due to differences in Python versions.

By ensuring these prerequisites are met, you will be well-prepared to engage with the tasks, run tests, and make the most out of this mock CodeSignal pre-screen assessment. Remember, a well-set-up development environment is key to a smooth and efficient coding experience.

2. **Sequential Progression**: Start with Level 1 and do not advance to the subsequent level until you have fully completed the preceding one üõ§Ô∏è. This methodical approach ensures a gradual and thorough understanding of the challenges presented.

3. **Choose Your Assessment**: Select either the File Storage System (beginner-intermediate) or Banking System (intermediate-advanced) based on your skill level and the type of role you're preparing for.

4. **Testing and Development Environment**: 
   - **File Storage**: Focus your coding efforts within the `practice_assessments/file_storage_system/simulation.py` file üñ•Ô∏è
   - **Banking System**: Focus your coding efforts within the `practice_assessments/banking_system/simulation.py` file üñ•Ô∏è

5. **Running Tests**: Utilize the provided test files to run unit tests against your code üß™:

   **File Storage System:**
   - For Level 1 tests: `python3 -m unittest test_simulation.TestSimulateCodingFramework.test_group_1`
   - For Level 2 tests: `python3 -m unittest test_simulation.TestSimulateCodingFramework.test_group_2`
   - For subsequent levels, adjust the `test_group_x` part accordingly
   
   **Banking System:**
   - Run all tests: `python test_simulation.py`
   - Individual test methods can be run using unittest module

6. **Refactoring**: As you progress through the levels, revisit and refactor your earlier solutions as needed to accommodate the additional functionality required by later tasks üîß. This iterative process is key to developing scalable and maintainable software.

To ensure the fastest possible progression through the levels, consider the following strategies:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Framework**: Before starting the timer, spend some time understanding the coding framework and the structure of the tasks (see the pdf in this repo) üìñ. This upfront investment will pay dividends by reducing the time needed to interpret tasks during the timed session.

2. **Plan Before You Code**: For each task, spend a few minutes planning your approach before you start coding üìù. This can include writing pseudocode, drawing diagrams, or outlining the steps you need to take. A clear plan will help you code more efficiently and reduce the time spent on debugging.

3. **Practice Speed Typing**: The physical act of typing can be a bottleneck üöÄ. Improving your typing speed through practice can have a surprisingly significant impact on your overall speed.

4. **Master the Art of Skimming**: Learn to quickly skim the task descriptions to identify the key requirements and constraints üîç. This skill will allow you to start formulating your solution even as you finish reading the task.

5. **Utilize Code Snippets and Libraries**: Where appropriate, use code snippets and libraries to avoid reinventing the wheel üõ†Ô∏è. However, be cautious not to waste time trying to force a library to do something it's not well-suited for.

6. **Parallelize Testing and Coding**: If possible, set up your environment so you can run tests on the code you've already written while continuing to work on other parts of the task üîÑ. This can help identify issues early and reduce overall development time.

7. **Focus on Passing Tests Over Perfection**: Aim to get a working solution as quickly as possible, even if it's not the most elegant üéØ. You can always refactor later if you have time remaining.

By incorporating these strategies, you can significantly increase your speed and efficiency, allowing you to progress through the levels at an accelerated pace ‚ö°.

The following table, sourced from [How hackable are automated coding assessments?](https://yanirseroussi.com/2023/05/26/how-hackable-are-automated-coding-assessments/), offers a detailed breakdown of the expected time allocation for questions within Industry Coding Assessments. It is formatted for clear understanding and reference:

| Level | Expected Time (minutes) |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | 10-15                   |
| 2     | 20-30                   |
| 3     | 30-60                   |
| 4     | 30-60                   |

When aggregating the time ranges across all levels, the cumulative estimate to complete the assessment ranges from 90 to 165 minutes. However, the stipulated completion time for candidates is set at 90 minutes. This discrepancy is intentional and serves a specific purpose as outlined below:

> The assessment's maximum allowed completion time is capped at 90 minutes. This constraint is not an expectation for candidates to solve all tasks within this limit. The rationale behind shorter assessments, despite their potential for a more accurate measurement of candidate skills, is rooted in the observation that candidate willingness to engage with the assessment drops significantly for tests exceeding 2 hours in duration. A critical aspect of evaluating candidates' capabilities lies in observing the extent of their progression within the allocated timeframe, rather than the completion of all tasks.

Adhering to these guidelines and completing the tasks within the designated time frame will equip you with practical experience in tackling coding assessments.

Best of luck, and remember to frequently test your solutions to track your progress and obtain feedback on your approach üçÄ.
